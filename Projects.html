        <h3>MRP-system</h3>
        <p>Material requirements planning (MRP) is a software-based integrated inventory and supply management system designed for businesses.</p>
        <p>Companies use MRP to estimate quantities of raw materials, maintain inventory levels, and schedule production and deliveries.</p>
        <p>MRP helps businesses and manufacturers define what is needed, how much is needed, and when materials are needed and works backward from a production plan for finished goods.
        MRP converts a plan into a list of requirements for the subassemblies, parts, and raw materials needed to produce a final product within the established schedule. MRP helps manufacturers get a grasp of inventory requirements while balancing both supply and demand.
        Using MRP, managers can determine their need for labor and supplies and improve their production efficiency by inputting data into the MRP scheme</p>
